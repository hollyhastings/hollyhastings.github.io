            <h3><li><a href="http://hollyhastings.me/justify">Justify</a></li></h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Justify is an open source web application excuse generator created for the Software Freedom Day 2014 and my excuse to start learning more Javascript. Justify uses AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap and randomly generates mostly coherent excuses. This project is also a Firefox OS app and can be found at the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com">Firefox Marketplace</a>. We currently have a 5 star rating!</li>
            </ul>
          </br>
          <h3><li>ToolShare</li></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Toolshare is a Django web application created for my Intro to Software Engineering course. This project was my first experience as a team lead in a group software project and I had a great time learning management skills from being thrown into the experience. I also learned the importance of planning for and managing risks and how to lead a team that gets things done and has enjoys doing it.</li>
          </ul>
        </br>
        <h3><li><a href="https://github.com/smt9020/Mixtery">Mixtery</a></li></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mixtery is a Rails web app created for the WicHacks Hackathon 2014. It is a game where you try to guess the song from a remixed sound clip. Mixtery helped me learn Rails outside of class. It was also my first experience with pair programming and using basic HTML, CSS,and jQuery. We won a prize for our use of the Echo Nest API!</li>
        </ul>
      </br>
      <h3><li><a href="https://github.com/hollyhastings/text_adventure">text_adventure</a></li></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>text_adventure is a ruby gem text adventure. This project is how I learned basic OO before being exposed to it in class. The gem started as a Code and Fix, but through learning more about process from my Software Engineering courses, I decided to freeze coding and start laying out an actual design.</li>
